The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where the specificity of selectors can lead to unexpected behavior.  The rule `.class1 .class2` is more specific than `.class1`, causing the latter to be overridden even if it appears later in the stylesheet. This can be especially problematic in larger projects, where the relationships between selectors may not be immediately obvious.
